  "summary": "Frontend DriverDashboardPage was updated to defensively render eligible orders (loading/error/empty/table) and to handle multiple OrderStatus variants via __kind__. Backend/main.mo diff is truncated and does not show any Orders data model or required order APIs, so core backend requirements cannot be verified as implemented.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Implement backend Orders persistence and expose createOrder/getMyOrders/getOrder/listEligibleDriverOrders/listAllOrders/updateOrderStatus with consistent OrderId generation, totalAmount computation, timestamps, status filtering, and required authorization patterns.",
      "reason": "The backend/main.mo diff excerpt only shows type/import declarations and is truncated before any Orders storage or the required public methods. There is no visible evidence that the required order APIs, persistence, filtering (eligible == status.__kind__ === 'purchased'), totalAmount computation, or admin/auth enforcement were implemented.",

    {
      "description": "Driver dashboard status badge logic includes additional status kinds beyond the explicitly required 'purchased' eligible status (pending/assigned/ready/inDelivery/delivered/cancelled) and displays user-facing labels for them.",
      "reason": "REQ-2 only requires rendering eligible orders and a status badge based on returned status shape; it does not request adding UI support for non-eligible lifecycle statuses (and REQ non-goals explicitly exclude accept/deliver workflows).",
